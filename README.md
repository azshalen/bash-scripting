# bash-scripting
Collection of bash scripts with the goal of better understanding and providing practice of how they work while trying to cover every possible command use and scenario.


The scripts are for practice, but there are imporant ones that will be built upon further.

IMPORTANT:
*sh ExecurePerms.sh*     - run to give all commands that do not have execute permissions

Scripts & What They Do:
- *AllCommands.sh*       	- all commands and notes are here commented out
- *ExecutePerms.sh*    		- give execute permission to all scripts that do not have it
- *Backup.sh*			- backup important data daily | another option with logrotate
